/// The output closure is for defining the concrete types that we need to pass around as generics

/// What we're really interested in is defining the `F` future for retrieving the next data chunk in the result set.
///
/// However, we in fact need a factory of these `F` future types, which is the closure here, aka the future maker.
/// This is because we will generally have to retrieve chunks until a result set is depleted, so we need
/// the ability to create new ones.
///
/// Since the future uses the exclusive mutable reference to the websocket, to satisfy the borrow checker
/// we return the mutable reference after the future is done it with, so it can be passed to the future maker again
/// and create a new future.
